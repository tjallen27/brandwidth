### Brandwidth

React app filtering data from IMBD movies api.

Time spent: 1h 30

To run:

- download repo
- yarn start

Dependancies:

- React Modal ('react-modal')

I chose React for the UI performance, being a data based application.

With more time I would have updated styling, fixed mapping through filtered data updated data displayed in the modal.
